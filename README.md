## Distinctiveness and Complexity
***"SmartPals!"*** is a Django web application that consists of 2 apps, ***"core"*** and ***"games"***. The "core" app mainly handles the users related stuff, while the "games" app handles the games mechanism. Each app has its own models, views, urls routes and static files. 

Apart from the basic registering and authenticating functions, the "core" app facilitates a friend system that allows users to search other users, send friend requests, response to  requests and unfriend other users. Among friends, games performance ranking is presented to create a friendly competitive environment and encourage improvement. 

The "games" app is a single page application with 5 games available. Each game is generated upon selection of game and level and executed by plain javascript. Simple and clear HTML structure,  modular JS design allows easy expansion with additional games. Plenty of css animations and transitions are implemented in response to game actions and results to improve users experience. Game activities are logged for users to access their records and ranking.

## Whatâ€™s contained in each file
### Models
The "core" app contains 2 model classes: **"User"** and **"FriendRequest"**. The "User" class contains methods to check if a user is a friend, to calculate users' age from their date of birth, serialize data for API and a classmethod to validate the date of birth input. The "FriendRequest" class captures the friend requests created by users. Requests will be removed upon target users' response, either accepted or declined. It contains a method to serialize data for API.

The "games" app contains 2 model classes: **"Game"** and **"Record"**. The "Game" class stores the information of each game such as game instructions, while the "Record" class stores the game results each time a user played a game.

### Urls, Views and Templates 
All pages in the project are extended from "layout.html" which defined the required reference to static files and external resources, as well as the basic structure of the application layout.

The core app defines routes and views to render the **"index.html"**, **"login.html"** and **"register.html"** pages as well as the logout action. It defines also API routes and views for retrieving and editing profile info, user searching, retrieving friends data and carrying out friend actions.

The games app only renders a single page, **"games.html"**. API routes and views are defined for retrieving game info, logging game results, retrieving games records and rankings.
